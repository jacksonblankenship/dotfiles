# Installation

Before continuing, be sure you've installed macOS command line tools

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

The following command will execute the bootstrap script, preparing the environment to work correctly with the dotfiles. **Warning:** This will override any conflicting dotfiles with the dotfiles in this repository. I recommend you only run this script if you **know what you're doing**.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -s -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacksonblankenship/dotfiles/main/.config/dotfiles/bootstrap.sh)" && exit
```

# Usage

After bootstrap, you'll have a fish function, `dot`, available in your environment. Use this alias as you would typically use Git. Keep in mind that we're working with a bare git repository, so there are a few quirks to keep an eye out for. Pushing and pulling work just fine. I recommend that you be specific about what you're attempting to interface with (i.e. `dot push origin main` or `dot pull origin main`).
